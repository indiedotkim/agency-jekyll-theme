Cloud and NoSQL genomics data integration made easy. BioInterchange transforms multiple genomic data formats into an annotated JSON format to enable harmonized data access and data mining. Instantly upload BioInterchange's JSON output into the Cloud or contemporary NoSQL databases. Elasticsearch, MongoDB, RethinkDB, and many other databases become immediately available for genomics data hosting with the press of a key.
